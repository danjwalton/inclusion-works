The Project will help ensure the delivery of a package of preventive, promotive, and curative health services.  At least 30% of all the services provided under the Project will be targeted at the poor. The specific project objectives are to improve (i) access to and use of urban primary health care (PHC) services in the project area, with a particular focus on extending provision to the poorest; (ii) the quality of urban PHC services in the project area; and (iii) the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and institutional and financial sustainability of PHC to meet the needs of the urban poor.The services will be designed to reduce child and maternal mortality and morbidity, and help the country achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Project will continue to contract out PHC services to nongovernment organizations (NGOs) through partnership agreements that were pioneered under the first Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-I). The Project will ensure pro-poor targeting by requiring that at least 30% of the preventive, promotive, and curative services provided are for the poor. Nutritional supplements will be given to moderately to severely malnourished women and children. The Project will support construction of 64 health facilities, upgrading of 4, and purchase of 12 apartments and/or buildings for PHC facilities in Dhaka city corporation.

These burdens are substantially attributed to unhealthy diets and tobacco use. Thus far, educational initiatives to reduce the consumption of ''risky commodities'' such as high salt foods, high sugar foods, palm oils and smoked tobacco have been disappointing. As a result, fiscal and regulatory strategies such as food taxes have been proposed to limit the consumption of these goods. Although numerous studies suggest that these strategies may benefit public health and be cost-effective, questions remain whether such approaches may have unintended consequences for health or economic development in India. This project aims to answer several of these questions using mathematical models designed specifically to simulate fiscal and regulatory strategies to reduce ''risky commodity'' use in India. These questions include: would reducing salt intake adversely increase iodine deficiency, a significant risk among rural populations? Will taxes on high sugar foods and palm oils lead to better health or will consumers simply cook with different unhealthy oils instead? Will tobacco taxation cause a perverse increase in cardiovascular disease deaths if users switch from taxed cigarettes to bidis (informal cigarettes)? In addition to conducting a systematic review on the health and economic impact of strategies proposed to limit the consumption of these commodities, the investigators will incorporate recently-collected data from population-representative surveys of disease risk and consumer purchasing into computer models to find optimal strategies to reduce high-risk commodity consumption and minimize potential adverse effects in India. The results from this study are expected to be used by Indian legislators to debate ongoing and future legislation regarding nutrition and tobacco policy at the national and state level. This project will also, more broadly, provide new knowledge to the public and to public health epidemiologists regarding how alternative approaches to regulation and fiscal policy may work, and how to minimize their adverse effects.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The program focuses on the impact of the Gilgel Gibe hydro-electric dam in terms of human and animal health, ecology and agronomy. Joint research is undertaken in different disciplines in the Gilgel Gibe area to improve the life quality of communities. Furthermore, research and educational capacities of Jimma University academic staff will be extended. The IUC partnership with JU commenced on 1 July 2007. It addresses the following research topics:1. Zoonotic and Animal diseases 2. Child Health and Nutrition 3. Environmental Health and Ecology 4. Epidemiology and Modelling of Infectious diseases 5. Soil Fertility 6. ICT-Library 7. Research CoordinationThere are many good reasons why the Gilgel Gibe dam area is chosen as the region where the research is undertaken, and why the specific project themes where chosen. Jimma University has been active for a long time in this region, and has already performed research in that region. For instance, a large longitudinal study was run to study child mortality in the region. It appeared that 11% of the children died within their first year. Furthermore, this region has paid the price in health and environmental degradation for the construction of the hydro-electric dam. Needless to say that this dam has important advantages in terms of providing electricity, but it has also led to serious disadvantages for the communities that are living in this region. Many people were displaced from their house as their land was flooded.A part of the research topics that are addressed in the different projects are related to the negative influences of the dam on human and animal health, agronomy, forestry and the environment in a broad sense. For instance, the dam is a vast water reservoir, which is an environment where the Anopheles mosquitos flourish. As the Anopheles mosquito is the vector for malaria transmission, the incidence of malaria has increased tremendously since that dam has come into existence. On the other hand, the research projects have also something to offer to the hydro-electric dam. Many of the the old dams in Ethiopoa can no longer be used because of siltation. Because of erosion, tons of fertile topsoil are lost to the rivers and further brought into the dam. This decreases the life expectancy of the dam enormously. When erosion can be prevented, this will benefit the life expectancy of the dam. This problem will be tackled from different angles by two projects, the soil fertility project and the environmental health and ecology project. - Staff, students of the Jimma University-- Individuals and households in the community and local development sector offices and society at large Overall developmental objective:To",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

To cope with this shortage, African providers practice task shifting, that is, allocating healthcare roles and procedures to less specialized health workers. VISION 2020 is a global initiative that strives to eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020. Some proponents of VISION 2020 believe that task shifting is essential to meeting this goal. Task shifting would see general health workers providing primary eye care, nurses or health assistants providing eyelid surgery for trachomatous trichiasis, and non-physician technicians providing cataract surgery. Primary eye care is already included in the health assistants' curriculum in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda, and approximately 150 cataract and 150 trachoma surgeons have been trained since 1990. Little is known, however, about the strengths and weaknesses of this strategy, the productivity and quality of service provided, or the retention and satisfaction of the personnel involved.

Estimates of Libya's holdings of MANPADS alone have been approximately 20,000, some of which may have been removed and sold.  As a result of US efforts to address this challenge, some MANPADS have been secured or made inoperable, however, much more of both conventional weapons and MANPADS remain to be addressed. In the wrong hands, these systems pose a significant threat to civil aviation. The US has initiated work with regional governments, international partners and allies to build a coordinated approach to this shared security challenge.The United States Government (USG) is currently implementing a phased-approach in dealing with MANPADS and other conventional weapons in Libya. In the near term and as the security situation permits, the first phase of a NTC-led MANPADS strategy is a rapid assessment of bunkers and ASAs to locate and secure stored MANPADS. This effort is currently underway through USG funding for civilian technical experts and British military explosive ordnance specialists. The second phase is a more detailed inventory of all weapons inside each bunker and ASA, completing NTC knowledge of its assets and liabilities. This lengthier and more resource-intensive step, which will include destruction of excess or at-risk MANPADS and unstable munitions, is essential to future NTC decisions and actions. The USG has identified funds through its Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF). Through the NDF, allies and partners can contribute to Phase 2 activities and any residual Phase 1 activities remaining at the start of Phase 2.The USG is currently negotiating a conventional weapons destruction technical arrangement (CWD/TA) with the NTC that will serve as the basis for expansion of current operations into Phase 2. Controlled Demolition Incorporated (CDI) will likely be the prime contractor for Phase 2 operations. Donors may earmark funds to specific subcontractors or for any or all the following activities that are currently under review by the NTC as outline in the CWD/TA: 1.Full inventory of all weapons storage areas in Libya 2.Destruction of MANPADS and other NTC approved weapons and munitions3.List of old, unstable, obsolete, or at-risk weapons and munitions recommended for destruction4.Destruction of NTC approved and requested weapons and munitions5.Complete inventory list of all sites surveyed so that NTC has baseline data for weapons and munitions currently held in country6.Immediate rapid assessment of bunkers and ammunition storage areas (ASAs)  not covered during phase 1 operations to locate and secure stored MANPADSForeign governments wishing to contribute to these Phase 2 operations, can transfer funds and enter into a non-legally binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the U.S. State Department to set f",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

MPRSD is based on social and economic development needs, development priorities for the road sector, and alternative investment strategies to support social and economic development priorities. It aims to (i) promote development of six main road corridors, (ii) remove capacity bottlenecks from the network to better connect rural areas, and (iii) support socio-economic development by improving road access and connectivity among growth centers. Based on MPRSD, Government of Chhattisgarh prepared and approved a priority investment program to improve about 5,000km of state roads at an estimated cost of about Rs105 billion ($2 billion). In order to support this plan, Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a loan of $180 million from its ordinary capital resources in 2003, which supported improvement of about 1,249km of state roads in Chhattisgarh as well as state roads sector reforms and the project was completed in July 2011. Considering the substantial improvement of implementing capacity of CGPWD and in order to continuously support the road sector development in Chhattisgarh, the second loan of state roads project was proposed and included in the India country operations business plan (COBP) 2012-2014 with $300 million for 2013 approval from the ordinary capital resources.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The Council, which consists of over 40 eminent Chinese and international members, was founded by the Government of China in 1992 to foster environmentally sustainable development. It plays an important role in helping China to implement its priorities under its Agenda 21 Action Plan and helps China develop integrated, coherent policies linking the environment to social and economic development. The Council is focusing its advice on issues including innovation for sustainable development; chemicals management; achieving emissions control; environmental health; and sustainable use of energy. / La contribution de l'ACDI permet à l'Université Simon Fraser de faire profiter au Conseil chinois de coopération internationale en environnement et en développement d'une expertise internationale et canadienne de sources très variées pour favoriser l'analyse des politiques et la formulation de recommandations sur des questions que le gouvernement de la Chine considère comme prioritaires. Le Conseil, qui regroupe une quarantaine de membres éminents de la Chine et d'autres pays, a été créé en 1992 par le gouvernement de la Chine pour favoriser un développement durable sur le plan de l'environnement. Il aide grandement la Chine à concrétiser les priorités de son plan relatif à Action 21 et à élaborer des politiques intégrées et cohérentes reliant l'environnement au développement social et économique.

To cope with this shortage, African providers practice task shifting, that is, allocating healthcare roles and procedures to less specialized health workers. VISION 2020 is a global initiative that strives to eliminate avoidable blindness by the year 2020. Some proponents of VISION 2020 believe that task shifting is essential to meeting this goal. Task shifting would see general health workers providing primary eye care, nurses or health assistants providing eyelid surgery for trachomatous trichiasis, and non-physician technicians providing cataract surgery. Primary eye care is already included in the health assistants' curriculum in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda, and approximately 150 cataract and 150 trachoma surgeons have been trained since 1990. Little is known, however, about the strengths and weaknesses of this strategy, the productivity and quality of service provided, or the retention and satisfaction of the personnel involved. This study will measure the effect of enhanced supervision of general health workers, and the impact of trichiasis and cataract surgeons, on the quality of and access to eye care services in three countries. Researchers will look at visual outcomes and patient satisfaction, as well as the productivity, retention and attrition of eye care providers, and the workplace factors involved therein.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The organisational and project managemental skills and structures of GLM Swaziland management will be strengthened through institutional capacity development with an aim to make GLM Swaziland an influential actor in Swazi grassroot sector concentrating on environmental and social issues. Knowledge will be spread by organising training and education in the cooperation areas Dlangeni and Msunduza on safe sanitation practices waste (minimisation re-use and recycling) and sustainable natural resources management. The training aims not only to increase people's knowledge but also behavioral changes and community participation. This will be achieved by creating different arenas for learning and participation and also by training of trainers in the communities. Training of Trainers -approach (ToT) will be a central method in the project to develop both organisational management skills and to increase knowledge on environmental issues.In Msunduza the project will continue the process started by the Environmental Health Education Project (EHEP) and Msunduza Dry Sanitation Project (MDSP project code 28000301) in which the communication and cooperation has been established with the local authority City Council (CC) and other actors in the area (such as clinic of Salvation Army in Msunduza schools and commercial actors waste recycling and re-use). The project is able to build on the results of the previous projects such as the Sanitation/EnviroClubs of dry toilet users in Msunduza and the Msunduza Community Waste Recycling Centre as well as on the partnerships and the networks of the City Council the Salvation Army and the local community leadership. These existing networks will allow the project to spread the knowledge further and even beyond the named project areas. A project steering group and community development committees will be established to better integrate important project stakeholders in project decision-making and to increase ownership of the project from the very beginning. The steering group will have both Swazi and foreign representatives (from GLM Zambia and Finland) and the community development committee will consist of various stakeholders of the respective communities.,No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

Thirteen years after the start of the second Intifada, Palestinians still bear the brunt of the crisis consequences  namely the continued occupation of Palestinian land and the illegal consolidation and expansion of settlements. Unemployment, poverty and food insecurity have spread with the decline of economic standards due to internal and external movement restrictions, limited control over natural resources, restricted access to local and international markets (including East Jerusalem and Israel). Coping mechanisms are reaching exhaustion. Moreover, the West Bank Barrier construction is isolating thousands of people from their land, dividing communities and restricting access to essential services. Therefore, the CAWP program not only focuses its interventions in Refugee camps but also has a particular intervention focus on protection related projects in areas where the permit regime has halted development and economic growth resulting in high unemployment rates and increased food insecurity.   General Objectives  Strategic Objective: Reduced impact of the Crisis through meeting critical basic needs of affected beneficiaries  Specific Objectives  Specific objective: Shore up the coping resources of vulnerable West Bank refugee families through the distribution of wages and provision of special work opportunities for those most at risk of forced displacement. Results  Project Output(s)1) Income of refugee household subsidised through work opportunities in UNRWA camps on one to three month contracts. 2) Income of refugee household subsidised through work opportunities in M&VCs on one to 3 month contracts. 3) UNRWA camps and M&VCs benefit from labour leading to improved public services and environment.4) Creation of job-days, labourers and materials for the improvement of environmental health, shelter and public space in UNRWA camps.5) Income/ employment opportunities for refugees most vulnerable to forced displacement, harassment and food insecurity due to movement restrictions, such as female-headed households, youth, disabled and herders living in Area C and Seam Zone.",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The project will continue the cooperation established during the Msunduza Dry Sanitation Project and the Environmental Health Education Project (EHEP) and combine and utilise the best practices from the two projects. During the project the cooperation network between the University of Swaziland (UNISWA) Green Living Movement (GLM) Swaziland the Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) and the City Council of Mbabane (CC) will organise trainings in Mnyamatsini Mangwaneni and Malagwane in sanitation waste management (reduce reuse and recycle) and grey water reuse. The education will target especially the youth of the communities which will gain skills for income generating activities (e.g. in dry toilet construction gardening and waste collection). A network between the youth groups will be established for peer support. Through them the benefits will be spread to the entire community.Education will target also authorities of the field as well as representatives of different medias in order disseminate improved sanitation and waste management schemes further and to promote open discussion of the development challenges. Through UNISWA the dissemination is further enhanced by inclusion of future professionals in environmental health integration of project themes and results in their curricula and by provide research on critical project themes such as health risks of human originated fertilisers and test-fields with comparative analysis.Cooperation between the two local partners UNISWA and GLM will enable organisational capacity building and transfer of know-how for a new local NGO with limited resources. Hence they will gain valuable local networks experience of field work and skills of project management in practise.Women's and girls' participation in trainings youth groups and decision-making is emphasized. Inequality will be decreased through inclusion of the disadvantaged through increases in income and by access to sanitation.  Affects of the climate change can already be seen in Swaziland as consecutive droughts which is mitigated by constructing waterless sanitation facilities with rainwater harvesting systems and grey water reuse.,Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The project focus is to improve sanitation and hygiene practices and give environmental education resulting to poverty alleviation. During the project implementation dry toilets will be built in public places such as markets schools health outposts and churches and selected social clubs and few selected demonstration toilets at household levels. To improve the accessibility to clean water also communal water points will be built. The project is designed to ultimately address poor environmental sanitation problem of accessibility to safe drinking water inadequate community environmental health education and poverty. In addition hygiene and health education is given as well as promoting of dry toilets in the area.In a long term project will benefit the whole Monze town but main beneficiaries in the first stage will be women children and youth as well as disabled people. The project fits well into the long term objectives of the GDTF; sustainable improvements on environmental sanitation and hygiene practices. The project also supports strategic goals of the local partner GLM Zambia such as goal to improve the livelihoods of local in a practical and balanced manner. The project also addresses Millennium development goal number seven (7); to insure environmental sustainability and to halve the population of people suffering from lack of water and sanitation. It also fit well to the Finnish cross cutting development policy objectives namely human rights gender equality and climate proofing. It is promoting water and sanitation as a human right. a) Human rights: the project activities focus on the least priviledged community in the town of Monze; it provides them better environment and sanitation & hygiene conditions which improve the life of people in many ways. b) Gender equality: Women groups are the main beneficiaries of the project and WASH in schools benefits especially girls. c) Climate proofing: Dry toilets are flood and drought proof and thus adapted to climate change and variability as well as reduce the risk of disasters such as groundwater contamination and disease epidemics.

In this project planning phase the information about the project target areas and their inhabitants are collected for making a more detailed plan for the next project phases. The planning is implemented in cooperation with local residents. The target groups are women and young people which are tried to find new income opportunities in the field of sustainable development.The project employs one person from each organization. Vigyan Vijay Foundation (VVF) working in West Delhi slum and Innovative Institute for Development and Education of All (IIDEA) North Delhi slum. Each organization is well connected with the residents of those areas. Organisations project personnel will collect information on environmental health problems and are connected with target groups to motivate them to actively participate the project.The Integrated Sustainable Energy and Ecological Development Association (INSEDA) which is also the main local partner is responsible for the environmental technical expertise of the project. In addition the applicant organization ASDA Finnish Association is involved in the project data collection analysing the results planning ot the next phases and monitoring.The main technical challenge in this phase is to develop a demonstration and test unit of mobile  biogas plant which processes organic waste from vegetable markets and produces gas for the local residents. This is a new innovation. It is important that the biogas plant is movable because the space for there is not space for the permanent solutions. Slums are located next to the vegetable markets. The markets generate a huge amount of organic waste that is landfilled and produce large amounts of methane. When handling waste biogas power plant the slurry will be dried and biogas compressed to cylinders which local residents can take advantage as cooking gas.The project also employes part-time doctor who discuss with the target groups on environmental health problems and offer them possibility for health advices and consultations for example once a week in the both project areas.,No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

Second, we will analyze how family planning education transmitted through religious radio broadcasts affects female empowerment and sexual behavior in Uganda. Both research questions will use novel data from the Measure DHS surveys, and use statistical methods that focus on estimating causal effects of the interventions.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The consumption of commercial and non-commercial (or informal alcohol) is growing. According to a 2001 World Health Organization survey, 46% of Vietnamese males over the age of 15 years consume alcohol at least once a week. Alcohol's health costs include cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and liver diseases. It is also an important risk factor for road traffic injuries, accounting for 15% of the 12,000 traffic deaths per year in Vietnam and 62% of the injuries. It was also responsible for increased aggressive behaviour, including 30% of those arrested for public disturbances.The Vietnamese government has tried to regulate homemade alcohol by putting policies and regulations, such as minimum age requirements, in place. However, enforcement for alcohol-related offences, including impaired driving, is weak. The Ministry of Health is working on strengthening alcohol control laws, but the lack of nationally representative data on alcohol use and its effects has made progress slow.This project is part of the multi-country International Alcohol Control (IAC) study. It includes case studies and uses natural experiments to assess the outcome and impacts of alcohol policies in Vietnam. It will address the potential effects of:-alcohol taxes or pricing policies on consumption levels across different population groups; -marketing restrictions on consumption levels across different population groups; and, -policies that restrict the physical availability of alcoholic beverages or reduce the hours of sale in retail outlets on consumption levels across different population groups.The project's specific objectives include:-To measure consumption of commercial and informal alcohol;-To document policy-relevant behaviours, including: place and time of purchase, prices paid, and exposure and salience of marketing;-To analyze potential effects of pricing policies, marketing restrictions, and physical availability across different population groups; and,-To evaluate how differences and changes in alcohol policy influence drinking behaviour and policy-related mediating variables.This study will provide internationally comparative data on Vietnam's alcohol policy and its effect. Given the increasing interest in the issue among policymakers, there is substantial potential for the research results to be translated into preventive health policies and programs.",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries.  The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world.  It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The  UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing projects which may be local or global and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000 ? each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects.  Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by  the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education  has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %.  A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for  more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO s have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created.  Finland is the second biggest donor goverment after Australia and she is currently also one of the donor government members of the UNPRPD Policy Board.  Finland  has channelled 206 million euros to the partnership during 2012-2013.

The program focuses on the impact of the Gilgel Gibe hydro -electric dam in terms of human and animal health, ecology and agronomy. Joint research is undertaken in different disciplines in the Gilgel Gibe area to improve the life quality of communities. Furthermore, research and educational capacities of Jimma University academic staff will be extended. The IUC partnership with JU commenced on 1 July 2007. It addresses the following research topics:1. Zoonotic and Animal diseases 2. Child Health and Nutrition 3. Environmental Health and Ecology 4. Epidemiology and Modelling of Infectious diseases 5. Soil Fertility 6. ICT -Library 7. Research CoordinationThere are many good reasons why the Gilgel Gibe dam area is chosen as the region where the research is undertaken, and why the specific project themes where chosen. Jimma University has been active for a long time in this region, and has already performed research in that region. For instance, a large longitudinal study was run to study child mortality in the region. It appeared that 11% of the children died within their first year. Furthermore, this region has paid the price in health and environmental degradation for the construction of the hydro -electric dam. Needless to say that this dam has important advantages in terms of providing electricity, but it has also led to serious disadvantages for the communities that are living in this region. Many people were displaced from their house as their land was flooded.A part of the research topics that are addressed in the different projects are related to the negative influences of the dam on human and animal health, agronomy, forestry and the environment in a broad sense. For instance, the dam is a vast water reservoir, which is an environment where the Anopheles mosquitos flourish. As the Anopheles mosquito is the vector for malaria transmission, the incidence of malaria has increased tremendously since that dam has come into existence. On the other hand, the research projects have also something to offer to the hydro -electric dam. Many of the the old dams in Ethiopoa can no longer be used because of siltation. Because of erosion, tons of fertile topsoil are lost to the rivers and further brought into the dam. This decreases the life expectancy of the dam enormously. When erosion can be prevented, this will benefit the life expectancy of the dam. This problem will be tackled from different angles by two projects, the soil fertility project and the environmental health and ecology project. - General objective:  Overall developmental objective:To improve the life of people in the Gilgel Gibe dam area and promote sustainable development through researc",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

New academic programmes have been developed to cater for a growing need of professionals in more areas of public health, e.g. Disaster Management. Today nearly all district health officers have received Master of Public Health Training.  MakCHS -SPH also runs short courses to meet the needs of those who need specific skills to work more efficiently. These include Health Services Management, Leadership and Management, Research Methods, Public Health in Complex Emergences. Another form of training is through work -based fellowship programs e.g. the HIV/AIDS Fellowship Programme funded by US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  which aims at enhancing leadership and management for HIV/AIDS programs in Uganda.A health systems research partnership was established in 2008, involving MakCHS -SPH, MoH, ITM, and two participating districts. This research initiative was referred to by the acronym DAHPU (District Action for Health Policy in Uganda). DAHPU was established in the two districts (Arua and Masindi) in 2009. It was anticipated that policy makers would benefit from DAHPU by learning from action research in health systems integration and optimization at district level to strengthen capacity for effective and equitable health care delivery.  Workshops were conducted and work plans developed in both districts.  By 2010 it was evident that engagement and understanding of the action research process was poor at local level. - General objective:  Capacity Strengthening for Health Systems Research and Health Policy Development in Uganda - Specific objective:  Strengthen capacity and involvement of MakCHS -SPH's in capacity building for the Uganda Health System and providing evidence and knowledge base for rational health policies and practices - Results:  1: A critical mass of health systems managers is trained at district, central and programmatic levels.2: Faculty of MakCHS SPH and MoH receives doctoral degree training to enhance their teaching and research capacities3: Research is undertaken in critical areas of Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition (MCHN) via an Evidence -Based Research Centre  4.

Educational initiatives to reduce the consumption of   risky commodities   such as foods high in salt and sugar, palm oils, and cigarettes have been disappointing.

This project will explore how to implement these kinds of strategies to maximize health and economic benefits while minimizing potential adverse consequences. Although many studies suggest that fiscal and regulatory approaches can be beneficial, questions remain whether they could have unintended consequences for public health or economic development in India. For example, would reducing salt intake cause greater iodine deficiency, already a significant risk among rural populations? Will taxes on high-sugar foods negatively affect the economy? How will reducing subsidies to palm oils and increasing subsidies for alternative oils affect food supplies? Will tobacco taxation cause an increase in cardiovascular disease deaths if users switch from taxed cigarettes to bidis (a popular, thin Indian-manufactured cigarette)? Researchers will develop mathematical models designed to simulate fiscal and regulatory strategies.

The result will be a modern accessible school with capacity to educate 70 students on each year of a three year education in total 210 students. Accessibility will be taken into account in all school buildings and premises including WASH facilities.The education provides general academic education combined with practical and theoretical training in one of 3 professions: energy assistant environment promoter and preschool assistant. The professions are chosen because of their relevance to local conditions. A 100 megawatt windmill park is due to be built in Tômbwa and there is increasing focus on alternative energy sources. Tômbwa is a desert town with very vulnerable environmental conditions giving the environment promoters ample opportunity to practice their trade. Finally Namibe province has one of the highest rates of preschool attendance in the country- although just 13.7%- and ADPP has operated preschools in the town for almost 15 years. Upon graduation the students receive a nationally recognized certificate enabling them to seek employment or continue to upper secondary technical education. The students also acquire a range of life skills carry out community actions and gain many new experiences. Environment protection activities form part of the education.  Persons with disabilities will be enrolled at the school and focus will be on ensuring that they are fully integrated. The rights of persons with disabilities will be promoted in the wider community. As part of the program the students will acquire ICT skills through the Dream School component. The idea is to support the development of rounded young adults with skills which are useful in the workforce and as active members of society. This includes the ability to be productive an entrepreneurial spirit ability to work as a team to take initiative and so on.  The school will work to foster links with the local business community including visits by local business people and workplace visits by the students.

There are indications of declining susceptibility of P. falciparum to ACT, both from Africa with selection of molecular markers associated with resistance to the long acting partner drug in ACT as well as reports of artemisinin resistance from South-East Asia, phenotypically characterized as prolonged parasite clearance times. This study aims to continue and deepen the temporal and spatial surveillance of selection of molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance as an early warning system of evolution and spread of P. falciparum tolerance/resistance against ACT in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania, and Zanzibar. In addition, we will study if the efficacy, i.e. parasite clearance times (both by a novel real time PCR based quantitative method and by microscopy) and PCR corrected cure rates, of artesunate-amoduaquine in Zanzibar and artemether-lumefantrine in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania, for treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria has been impaired by the selection of ACT tolerance/resistance markers that occurred in the respective parasite populations during a decade of wide scale ACT use.

New low cost energy resources, such as rice husk, straw and coconut shell briquettes are needed since wood has become scarce and the price increases continuously. Unfortunately the new energy resources accelerate the problem with high concentrations of particles and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. WHO states that air pollution is the largest single environmental health risk and most severe is the household pollution due to indoor smoke from cooking fuel. The objective of this project is to develop better understanding of how soot particles are formed in biomass combustion, how they burn in the fire and how the resulting ash can be removed from the exhaust. At Gadjah Mada University in Indonesia we will do experimental studies of how briquettes of different design will burn and form soot. At Chalmers University we will focus on how soot particles burn in the fire and can be trapped downstream. The co-workers in Indonesia have experience in briquette manufacturing and small scale biomass combustion.

The project started in 2011. The project purpose is on the one hand to facilitate revision of the government?s ICT policy and strengthening of the capacity of the Ministry of Communication Science and Technology of Tanzania (MCST) and national institutions and on the other hand strengthening of the business environment in Tanzania especially from a perspective of technology enterprises and innovations. Practical innovation solutions will be developed within the framework of the innovation program.  Project?s mid-term review was carried out in 2013. The mid-term review brought out that the components related to the revision of government?s ICT-policy and strengthening of the ministry had faced problems and delays but the innovation component had instead  progressed well and produced significant results.  Innovation spaces have been created for young technology entrepreneurs which has promoted generation of well-functioning entrepreneur communities.  Community based innovation activity has also got off a good start in six regions as well as business incubator activity and cooperation with the most important universities in Tanzania. The mid-term review found that the project had also promoted the IT-skills entrepreneurship and innovation of vulnerable groups (women disabled youthpeople of remote and poor communities). The mid-term review recommended additional funding for the innovation component in order to achieve the original objectives and increase their impact further. The objective of the additional funding is to apply well-functioning concepts of Finland?s innovation system more broadly in Tanzania increase support to women entrepreneurs Living Lab centers and innovation spaces. The revision of ICT-policy and strengthening of the capacity of the Ministry are progressing again after delays.  The original budget for the project is 5 million euros.

In 2000, it accounted for approximately 5% of all deaths and 9.7% of all disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost. DALY is a measure of overall disease burden expressed as the number of years lost as a result of poor health, disability, or early death. There is strong evidence that policies that increase the price of alcohol and address the volume of alcohol advertising are effective at reducing alcohol consumption. Despite a relatively large body of work, nearly all studies that have examined the impact of pricing, taxation, or advertising policies on alcohol use have been conducted using data from the United States or other high-income countries. A scoping review identified a single study conducted with data from Latin America. This research project will address that gap. It will examine the impact of pricing, taxation, and advertising policies on alcohol consumption, using individual- and household-level data and rigorous statistical methods, in four South American low- and middle-income countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Researchers will link national survey data from a large number of existing datasets to price data obtained from national statistical agencies and market research organizations. It will also use self-reported prices and unit values, when available. The project will specifically aim to examine the following:-impact of alcohol pricing, taxation, and advertising policies on alcohol onset-impact of alcohol prices and taxes on the number of users vs. non-users and consumption-influence of socio-economic status, gender, and age on the relationship between alcohol pricing, taxation, and advertising policies and alcohol use-impact of tobacco prices on alcohol use.The researchers will work with knowledge-transfer platform teams and decision-makers in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru to design a tailored knowledge transfer and exchange strategy. The research will provide important evidence on the potential benefits and limitations of current tax and advertising strategies in the four countries.",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The increasingly digital nature of economies, even in the developing world, is one reason for this phenomenon. The Internet, and intermediaries such as Apple s iTunes, now serve as the main sources for knowledge and creative goods (including music, film, books) under copyright protection. Meanwhile, the growth of digital piracy (copying and online file sharing), and the creative economy s increasing value, have made the debate on the role of copyright even more pressing. The debate includes two polarized positions. On the one hand, people are pushing for stronger intellectual property protections. The last two decades have seen national legislation and international agreements bring in tighter intellectual property enforcement in the digital environment. For example, recent trade treaties include proposals to restrict domestic flexibility in intellectual property policy.On the other hand, there is a movement to promote greater flexibility in intellectual property protections for a more open Internet. A growing number of countries have enacted, or are considering, flexible  fair use -style legislations. Open access and open educational initiatives, which also include more flexible approaches to copyright, are also gaining strength and broadening their scope. An international treaty to expand access to materials for people with visual impairments also recognized limitations and exceptions to copyright.Most of the policy debates about copyright protection in the digital age lack empirical evidence to support the claims on both sides. This research project will address that gap. Researchers will:-establish an interdisciplinary and global network to examine the economic and social impact of copyright flexibilities, legal enforcement, and alternative licensing systems;-organize activities at the University of Cape Town to bring researchers, civil society, industry, and policymakers together to discuss intellectual property issues;-identify urgent, global, and local research priorities, and analyze global interconnections; and,-outline a research agenda exploring the value of open and flexible approaches to intellectual property in the digital economy.Funding will also allow leading Asian and Latin American researchers to participate in the 2013 Global Congress on Public and Intellectual Property in Cape Town. Consumers International will coordinate the second part of this project, which will produce comparable data on how different types of copyright reforms and flexibilities influence consumers and innovative businesses. The survey design, and the diagnostic and planning exercise, will provide the basis for a long-term research network that will produce academic work on the value of openness in developing countries  digital economies.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The project will continue the cooperation established during the Msunduza Dry Sanitation Project (MDSP project code 28000301) and the Environmental Health Education Project (EHEP) and combine and utilise the best practices from the two projects. During the project the cooperation network between the University of Swaziland (UNISWA) Green Living Movement (GLM) Swaziland the Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) and the City Council of Mbabane (CC) will organise trainings in Mnyamatsini Mangwaneni and Malagwane in sanitation waste management (reduce reuse and recycle) and grey water reuse. The education will target especially the youth of the communities which will gain skills for income generating activities (e.g. in dry toilet construction gardening and waste collection). A network between the youth groups will be established for peer support. Through them the benefits will be spread to the entire community.Education will target also authorities of the field as well as representatives of different medias in order disseminate improved sanitation and waste management schemes further and to promote open discussion of the development challenges. Through UNISWA the dissemination is further enhanced by inclusion of future professionals in environmental health integration of project themes and results in their curricula and by provide research on critical project themes such as health risks of human originated fertilisers and test-fields with comparative analysis.Cooperation between the two local partners UNISWA and GLM will enable organisational capacity building and transfer of know-how for a new local NGO with limited resources. Hence they will gain valuable local networks experience of field work and skills of project management in practise.Women s and girls  participation in trainings youth groups and decision-making is emphasized. Inequality will be decreased through inclusion of the disadvantaged through increases in income and by access to sanitation.  Affects of the climate change can already be seen in Swaziland as consecutive droughts which is mitigated by constructing waterless sanitation facilities with rainwater harvesting systems and grey water reuse.,Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

In this project planning phase the information about the project target areas and their inhabitants are collected for making a more detailed plan for the next project phases. The planning is implemented in cooperation with local residents. The target groups are women and young people which are tried to find new income opportunities in the field of sustainable development.The project employs one person from each organization. Vigyan Vijay Foundation (VVF) working in West Delhi slum and Innovative Institute for Development and Education of All (IIDEA) North Delhi slum. Each organization is well connected with the residents of those areas. Organisations project personnel will collect information on environmental health problems and are connected with target groups to motivate them to actively participate the project.The Integrated Sustainable Energy and Ecological Development Association (INSEDA) which is also the main local partner is responsible for the environmental technical expertise of the project. In addition the applicant organization ASDA Finnish Association is involved in the project data collection analysing the results planning ot the next phases and monitoring.The main technical challenge in this phase is to develop a demonstration and test unit of mobile  biogas plant which processes organic waste from vegetable markets and produces gas for the local residents. This is a new innovation. It is important that the biogas plant is movable because the space for there is not space for the permanent solutions. Slums are located next to the vegetable markets. The markets generate a huge amount of organic waste that is landfilled and produce large amounts of methane. When handling waste biogas power plant the slurry will be dried and biogas compressed to cylinders which local residents can take advantage as cooking gas.The project also employes part-time doctor who discuss with the target groups on environmental health problems and offer them possibility for health advices and consultations for example once a week in the both project areas.,No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

New low cost energy resources, such as rice husk, straw and coconut shell briquettes are needed since wood has become scarce and the price increases continuously. Unfortunately the new energy resources accelerate the problem with high concentrations of particles and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. WHO states that air pollution is the largest single environmental health risk and most severe is the household pollution due to indoor smoke from cooking fuel. The objective of this project is to develop better understanding of how soot particles are formed in biomass combustion, how they burn in the fire and how the resulting ash can be removed from the exhaust. At Gadjah Mada University in Indonesia we will do experimental studies of how briquettes of different design will burn and form soot. At Chalmers University we will focus on how soot particles burn in the fire and can be trapped downstream. The co-workers in Indonesia have experience in briquette manufacturing and small scale biomass combustion. The group at Chalmers has experience in Computational Fluid Dynamics and in removing and burning particles in diesel exhaust. The combined knowledge will lead to new understanding and design concepts that can be used for making new stoves and furnaces with low emissions.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

Educational initiatives to reduce the consumption of ''risky commodities'' such as foods high in salt and sugar, palm oils, and cigarettes have been disappointing. As a result, fiscal and regulatory strategies such as food taxes have been proposed to limit consumption of these goods. This project will explore how to implement these kinds of strategies to maximize health and economic benefits while minimizing potential adverse consequences. Although many studies suggest that fiscal and regulatory approaches can be beneficial, questions remain whether they could have unintended consequences for public health or economic development in India. For example, would reducing salt intake cause greater iodine deficiency, already a significant risk among rural populations? Will taxes on high-sugar foods negatively affect the economy? How will reducing subsidies to palm oils and increasing subsidies for alternative oils affect food supplies? Will tobacco taxation cause an increase in cardiovascular disease deaths if users switch from taxed cigarettes to bidis (a popular, thin Indian-manufactured cigarette)? Researchers will develop mathematical models designed to simulate fiscal and regulatory strategies. They will incorporate recently collected survey data of disease risk and consumer purchasing into the models to determine optimal strategies. Indian legislators are expected to use the study results to inform debates on existing and future legislation regarding nutrition and tobacco policy at the national and state levels. The research will also provide new knowledge about alternative approaches to regulation and fiscal policy and how to minimize any adverse effects.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

MEDECINE TROPICALE /  PROG.PLURIANNUELS  2014-2016 UGANDA,"Background:  MakCHS -SPH offers Master programmes in Public Health, Nutrition and Health Services Research, as well as undergraduate training in Environmental Health Sciences. New academic programmes have been developed to cater for a growing need of professionals in more areas of public health, e.g. Disaster Management. Today nearly all district health officers have received Master of Public Health Training.   MakCHS -SPH also runs short courses to meet the needs of those who need specific skills to work more efficiently. These include Health Services Management, Leadership and Management, Research Methods, Public Health in Complex Emergences. Another form of training is through work -based fellowship programs e.g. the HIV/AIDS Fellowship Programme funded by US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  which aims at enhancing leadership and management for HIV/AIDS programs in Uganda.  A health systems research partnership was established in 2008, involving MakCHS -SPH, MoH, ITM, and two participating districts. This research initiative was referred to by the acronym DAHPU (District Action for Health Policy in Uganda). DAHPU was established in the two districts (Arua and Masindi) in 2009. It was anticipated that policy makers would benefit from DAHPU by learning from action research in health systems integration and optimization at district level to strengthen capacity for effective and equitable health care delivery.  Workshops were conducted and work plans developed in both districts.  By 2010 it was evident that engagement and understanding of the action research process was poor at local level. - General objective:  Capacity Strengthening for Health Systems Research and Health Policy Development in Uganda - Specific objective:  Strengthen capacity and involvement of MakCHS -SPH's in capacity building for the Uganda Health System and providing evidence and knowledge base for rational health policies and practices - Results:  1: A critical mass of health systems managers is trained at district, central and programmatic levels. 2: Faculty of MakCHS SPH and MoH receives doctoral degree training to enhance their teaching and research capacities 3: Research is undertaken in critical areas of Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition (MCHN) via an Evidence -Based Research Centre   4.

The result will be a modern accessible school with capacity to educate 70 students on each year of a three year education in total 210 students. Accessibility will be taken into account in all school buildings and premises including WASH facilities.The education provides general academic education combined with practical and theoretical training in one of 3 professions: energy assistant environment promoter and preschool assistant. The professions are chosen because of their relevance to local conditions. A 100 megawatt windmill park is due to be built in Tômbwa and there is increasing focus on alternative energy sources. Tômbwa is a desert town with very vulnerable environmental conditions giving the environment promoters ample opportunity to practice their trade. Finally Namibe province has one of the highest rates of preschool attendance in the country- although just 13.7%- and ADPP has operated preschools in the town for almost 15 years. Upon graduation the students receive a nationally recognized certificate enabling them to seek employment or continue to upper secondary technical education. The students also acquire a range of life skills carry out community actions and gain many new experiences. Environment protection activities form part of the education.  Persons with disabilities will be enrolled at the school and focus will be on ensuring that they are fully integrated. The rights of persons with disabilities will be promoted in the wider community. As part of the program the students will acquire ICT skills through the Dream School component. The idea is to support the development of rounded young adults with skills which are useful in the workforce and as active members of society. This includes the ability to be productive an entrepreneurial spirit ability to work as a team to take initiative and so on.  The school will work to foster links with the local business community including visits by local business people and workplace visits by the students. By the third year of the education the students have a 3 week work experience placement.

There are indications of declining susceptibility of P. falciparum to ACT, both from Africa with selection of molecular markers associated with resistance to the long acting partner drug in ACT as well as reports of artemisinin resistance from South-East Asia, phenotypically characterized as prolonged parasite clearance times. This study aims to continue and deepen the temporal and spatial surveillance of selection of molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance as an early warning system of evolution and spread of P. falciparum tolerance/resistance against ACT in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania, and Zanzibar.

The project will continue the cooperation established during the Msunduza Dry Sanitation Project (MDSP project code 28000301) and the Environmental Health Education Project (EHEP) and combine and utilise the best practices from the two projects. During the project the cooperation network between the University of Swaziland (UNISWA) Green Living Movement (GLM) Swaziland the Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) and the City Council of Mbabane (CC) will organise trainings in Mnyamatsini Mangwaneni and Malagwane in sanitation waste management (reduce reuse and recycle) and grey water reuse. The education will target especially the youth of the communities which will gain skills for income generating activities (e.g. in dry toilet construction gardening and waste collection). A network between the youth groups will be established for peer support. Through them the benefits will be spread to the entire community.Education will target also authorities of the field as well as representatives of different medias in order disseminate improved sanitation and waste management schemes further and to promote open discussion of the development challenges. Through UNISWA the dissemination is further enhanced by inclusion of future professionals in environmental health integration of project themes and results in their curricula and by provide research on critical project themes such as health risks of human originated fertilisers and test-fields with comparative analysis.Cooperation between the two local partners UNISWA and GLM will enable organisational capacity building and transfer of know-how for a new local NGO with limited resources. Hence they will gain valuable local networks experience of field work and skills of project management in practise.Women s and girls  participation in trainings youth groups and decision-making is emphasized. Inequality will be decreased through inclusion of the disadvantaged through increases in income and by access to sanitation.  Affects of the climate change can already be seen in Swaziland as consecutive droughts which is mitigated by constructing waterless sanitation facilities with rainwater harvesting systems and grey water reuse.,Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The project aims to improve environmental sanitation situation and contribute to poverty reduction in Freedom- and other compounds in Monze town Zambia. Lack of sanitation is one of the biggest challanges in the area. This causes spreading of diseases and raises mortality rates (especially among children).This raises health care costs dramatically and decreases the possibility to go work and school and participate in society. Sanitation should be basic human right for all. The project focus is to increase environmental sanitation education enhance hygiene practices and contribute to poverty reduction. The project continuation will build on its past achievements lessons and experiences of the pilot phase (2014-2015). The project will increase community knowledge on environmental health and sanitation education through enhanced use of print and electronic media esp. community radio community theatre and production of visual educational materials. Through these strategies the project is expected to reach more people within and outside the project area. Sanitation education will also be extended to schools through school environment or sanitation clubs where they exist. There will be more household and public toilets built using different innovative DT models and building methods. Other important areas of project interest will be development of backyard gardening and commercializing organic manure&urine from DT s. The project will install water sources and hand washing points especially at public places such as schools health posts and churches in co-operation with SWASCO.In the first stage of the project it could not met all the demands of the neighbouring areas of Freedom compound and it became clear that the project area needs to be expanded. In the continuation of the project the aim is to involve new areas within Monze township. The new areas will be chosen together with local stakeholders such as SWASCO GLM Monze City Council and Monze District Office based on the experiences and contacts gathered during the first project period. SWASCO the Southern Water and Sewerage Company (local service provider) is planning to execute a large water management project in Monze to improve the coverage of the water network.

Are we able to experience the diversity and different people as an asset in our lives? Also what are the benefits of diversity in our society? What can we learn from diversity and why bullying shall not be acceptable?The key methods are interaction and experiental pedagogy. It is important to encourage children and young people to participate so that they can feel that they have a cahnge to influence to their own lives.

The project aims to raise discussion about issues that are important to the people in rural communities. Through Jamii FM community radio programmes people in the rural communities get their voice heard in local media and have a better chance to take part in the local discussion about issues concerning their livelihoods and the allocation of public resources.The direct beneficiaries of the project are the dozens of young journalists taking part in the Jamii FM programme production including female journalists and journalists with disabilities. Hundreds of people benefit from the project by joining the village discussions arranged as part of the radio programmes and other community media productions. When people in the rural communities feel that their views are being listened to they are also more inclined to actively try to make an impact on their own living conditions. Among the direct beneficiaries are also all inhabitants within the coverage area of Jamii FM (almost one million people) who can listen to the radio broadcasts.The community media activities address human rights issues through the right to information and communication. Special support will be provided to ensure that the programme production is inclusive and gives the voice also to women and other vulnerable groups.The key project activities include training of young community media journalists in radio production support for the marketing of Jamii FM support for radio operations ? especially women journalists journalists with disabilities and special programmes about gas production and the environment ? and supporting the procurement of updated media equipment.,Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

Research has shown that increasing physical activity, eating a healthier diet and losing weight, can prevent the progression to long term diabetes. This research study involves developing and evaluating an innovative intervention for the South African health system that will help prevent women with previous gestational diabetes from developing type 2 diabetes in the years after pregnancy. The study setting is in the cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg and will specifically target women at risk from poor communities who use the public health system. The proposed intervention will consist of offering the women a special test to see whether they have diabetes 6 weeks after delivery, along with counselling about a healthy lifestyle from a trained counsellor at the clinic and in a community venue. Currently, no such test, information or counselling support exists for these women after they have had their babies. The intervention will be introduced at primary care clinics, where mothers usually go to have their babies vaccinated during their first year of life, in order to make it convenient for them to access the service. This also offers an opportunity to test a post-partum intervention which addresses the mother's and child's health and nutrition together, rather than separately as is current practice. Before and during the implementation of the intervention, research with women, healthcare providers and health service managers will help to ensure that the proposed components of the intervention are suitable and practical in the real life clinic and community setting. If the intervention proves to be effective in preventing diabetes, further research and advocacy activities will explore the opportunities and barriers to extending the intervention across South African health services more broadly.",Major gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The consumption of commercial and non-commercial (or informal alcohol) is growing. According to a 2001 World Health Organization survey, 46% of Vietnamese males over the age of 15 years consume alcohol at least once a week. Alcohol's health costs include cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and liver diseases. It is also an important risk factor for road traffic injuries, accounting for 15% of the 12,000 traffic deaths per year in Vietnam and 62% of the injuries. It was also responsible for increased aggressive behaviour, including 30% of those arrested for public disturbances.The Vietnamese government has tried to regulate homemade alcohol by putting policies and regulations, such as minimum age requirements, in place. However, enforcement for alcohol-related offences, including impaired driving, is weak. The Ministry of Health is working on strengthening alcohol control laws, but the lack of nationally representative data on alcohol use and its effects has made progress slow.This project is part of the multi-country International Alcohol Control (IAC) study. It includes case studies and uses natural experiments to assess the outcome and impacts of alcohol policies in Vietnam. It will address the potential effects of:-alcohol taxes or pricing policies on consumption levels across different population groups; -marketing restrictions on consumption levels across different population groups; and, -policies that restrict the physical availability of alcoholic beverages or reduce the hours of sale in retail outlets on consumption levels across different population groups.The project's specific objectives include:-To measure consumption of commercial and informal alcohol;-To document policy-relevant behaviours, including: place and time of purchase, prices paid, and exposure and salience of marketing;-To analyze potential effects of pricing policies, marketing restrictions, and physical availability across different population groups; and,-To evaluate how differences and changes in alcohol policy influence drinking behaviour and policy-related mediating variables.This study will provide internationally comparative data on Vietnam's alcohol policy and its effect. Given the increasing interest in the issue among policymakers, there is substantial potential for the research results to be translated into preventive health policies and programs.",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

Educational initiatives to reduce the consumption of ''risky commodities'' such as foods high in salt and sugar, palm oils, and cigarettes have been disappointing. As a result, fiscal and regulatory strategies such as food taxes have been proposed to limit consumption of these goods. This project will explore how to implement these kinds of strategies to maximize health and economic benefits while minimizing potential adverse consequences. Although many studies suggest that fiscal and regulatory approaches can be beneficial, questions remain whether they could have unintended consequences for public health or economic development in India. For example, would reducing salt intake cause greater iodine deficiency, already a significant risk among rural populations? Will taxes on high-sugar foods negatively affect the economy? How will reducing subsidies to palm oils and increasing subsidies for alternative oils affect food supplies? Will tobacco taxation cause an increase in cardiovascular disease deaths if users switch from taxed cigarettes to bidis (a popular, thin Indian-manufactured cigarette)? Researchers will develop mathematical models designed to simulate fiscal and regulatory strategies. They will incorporate recently collected survey data of disease risk and consumer purchasing into the models to determine optimal strategies. Indian legislators are expected to use the study results to inform debates on existing and future legislation regarding nutrition and tobacco policy at the national and state levels.

The program focuses on the impact of the Gilgel Gibe hydro -electric dam in terms of human and animal health, ecology and agronomy. Joint research is undertaken in different disciplines in the Gilgel Gibe area to improve the life quality of communities. Furthermore, research and educational capacities of Jimma University academic staff will be extended.  The IUC partnership with JU commenced on 1 July 2007. It addresses the following research topics: 1. Zoonotic and Animal diseases  2. Child Health and Nutrition  3. Environmental Health and Ecology  4. Epidemiology and Modelling of Infectious diseases  5. Soil Fertility  6. ICT -Library  7. Research Coordination  There are many good reasons why the Gilgel Gibe dam area is chosen as the region where the research is undertaken, and why the specific project themes where chosen.  Jimma University has been active for a long time in this region, and has already performed research in that region. For instance, a large longitudinal study was run to study child mortality in the region. It appeared that 11% of the children died within their first year. Furthermore, this region has paid the price in health and environmental degradation for the construction of the hydro -electric dam. Needless to say that this dam has important advantages in terms of providing electricity, but it has also led to serious disadvantages for the communities that are living in this region. Many people were displaced from their house as their land was flooded. A part of the research topics that are addressed in the different projects are related to the negative influences of the dam on human and animal health, agronomy, forestry and the environment in a broad sense. For instance, the dam is a vast water reservoir, which is an environment where the Anopheles mosquitos flourish. As the Anopheles mosquito is the vector for malaria transmission, the incidence of malaria has increased tremendously since that dam has come into existence. On the other hand, the research projects have also something to offer to the hydro -electric dam. Many of the the old dams in Ethiopoa can no longer be used because of siltation. Because of erosion, tons of fertile topsoil are lost to the rivers and further brought into the dam. This decreases the life expectancy of the dam enormously. When erosion can be prevented, this will benefit the life expectancy of the dam. This problem will be tackled from different angles by two projects, the soil fertility project and the environmental health and ecology project.  - General objective:  Overall developmental objective: To improve the life of people in the Gilgel Gibe dam area and promote sustainable development",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

WB) developing country governments development partner agencies and civil society organisations in the framework of the Social Protection Inter-Agency Cooperation Board (SPIAC-B) where Finland is a respected member.  Finland s previous support has enabled several countries in Asia and Africa to set up broadly participatory national dialogue processes and high-level technical studies for shaping national SPF strategies and coordinating the activities of national and international partners. The next phase will focus on the development testing and documentation of joint tools for country level Inter-Agency Social Protection Assessments (ISPA). As an outcome developing country governments will receive increasingly well coordinated and harmonised support to their efforts to develop social protection floors and national social protection systems. As a development outcome inequalities will be reduced when vulnerable children women and men will be better able to manage the risks of impoverishment in all phases of their life cycle (e.g. childhood maternity  ill health old age disability).,Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries.  The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world.  It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The  UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000 ? each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects.  Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by  the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education  has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %.  A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for  more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO s have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created.  Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is  also  member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee.  Finland  has channelled 6.060.000 million euros to the partnership  (2012-2015).

The project started in 2011. The project purpose is on the one hand to facilitate revision of the government?s ICT policy and strengthening of the capacity of the Ministry of Communication Science and Technology of Tanzania (MCST) and national institutions and on the other hand strengthening of the business environment in Tanzania especially from a perspective of technology enterprises and innovations. Practical innovation solutions will be developed within the framework of the innovation program.  Project?s mid-term review was carried out in 2013. The mid-term review brought out that the components related to the revision of government?s ICT-policy and strengthening of the ministry had faced problems and delays but the innovation component had instead  progressed well and produced significant results.  Innovation spaces have been created for young technology entrepreneurs which has promoted generation of well-functioning entrepreneur communities.  Community based innovation activity has also got off a good start in six regions as well as business incubator activity and cooperation with the most important universities in Tanzania. The mid-term review found that the project had also promoted the IT-skills entrepreneurship and innovation of vulnerable groups (women disabled youthpeople of remote and poor communities). The mid-term review recommended additional funding for the innovation component in order to achieve the original objectives and increase their impact further. The objective of the additional funding is to apply well-functioning concepts of Finland?s innovation system more broadly in Tanzania increase support to women entrepreneurs Living Lab centers and innovation spaces. The revision of ICT-policy and strengthening of the capacity of the Ministry are progressing again after delays.  The original budget for the project is 5 million euros. Additional funding is 08 million euros. The project period is 2011-15. Main actors: MCST COSTECH universities civil society organizations and private enterprises.

In this project planning phase the information about the project target areas and their inhabitants are collected for making a more detailed plan for the next project phases. The planning is implemented in cooperation with local residents. The target groups are women and young people which are tried to find new income opportunities in the field of sustainable development.The project employs one person from each organization. Vigyan Vijay Foundation (VVF) working in West Delhi slum and Innovative Institute for Development and Education of All (IIDEA) North Delhi slum. Each organization is well connected with the residents of those areas. Organisations project personnel will collect information on environmental health problems and are connected with target groups to motivate them to actively participate the project.The Integrated Sustainable Energy and Ecological Development Association (INSEDA) which is also the main local partner is responsible for the environmental technical expertise of the project. In addition the applicant organization ASDA Finnish Association is involved in the project data collection analysing the results planning ot the next phases and monitoring.The main technical challenge in this phase is to develop a demonstration and test unit of mobile  biogas plant which processes organic waste from vegetable markets and produces gas for the local residents. This is a new innovation. It is important that the biogas plant is movable because the space for there is not space for the permanent solutions. Slums are located next to the vegetable markets. The markets generate a huge amount of organic waste that is landfilled and produce large amounts of methane. When handling waste biogas power plant the slurry will be dried and biogas compressed to cylinders which local residents can take advantage as cooking gas.The project also employes part-time doctor who discuss with the target groups on environmental health problems and offer them possibility for health advices and consultations for example once a week in the both project areas.,No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries. The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world. It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000 ? each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects. Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %. A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO's have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created. Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is also member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee. Finland has channelled 7.560.000 million euros to the partnership (2012-2016).

New low cost energy resources, such as rice husk, straw and coconut shell briquettes are needed since wood has become scarce and the price increases continuously. Unfortunately the new energy resources accelerate the problem with high concentrations of particles and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. WHO states that air pollution is the largest single environmental health risk and most severe is the household pollution due to indoor smoke from cooking fuel. The objective of this project is to develop better understanding of how soot particles are formed in biomass combustion, how they burn in the fire and how the resulting ash can be removed from the exhaust. At Gadjah Mada University in Indonesia we will do experimental studies of how briquettes of different design will burn and form soot. At Chalmers University we will focus on how soot particles burn in the fire and can be trapped downstream. The co-workers in Indonesia have experience in briquette manufacturing and small scale biomass combustion. The group at Chalmers has experience in Computational Fluid Dynamics and in removing and burning particles in diesel exhaust. The combined knowledge will lead to new understanding and design concepts that can be used for making new stoves and furnaces with low emissions.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

2016161328,1ETH1,2016,C01,ODA Grants,Finland,Ethiopia,0.00809845,,Industrial crops/export crops,F.a: Reduction of vulnerability in Ethiopian coffee production,F.A: REDUCTION OF VULNERABILITY IN ETHIOPIAN COFFEE PRODUCTION,"Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, has more than 1.2 million coffee growers, 95% of which are smallholders, and around 16 million households, nearly a fifth of the population, depend on coffee for their livelihood. Coffee contributes a third of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Ethiopian coffee farmers face challenges like low productivity, quality inconsistency, lack of access to capital, lack of direct sales contacts and marketing skills. As temperatures rise and rains become more erratic, Ethiopian coffee farmers have seen decreasing yields. A poorly developed insurance market prevents people without collateral from getting access to credit, and leave farmers vulnerable when facing, for example, droughts and diseases on coffee trees. It also prevents farmers from affording the investment required for diversification of farming income. In rural areas, manual agricultural wage workers are in the very weakest position. Small producer organisations usually don't have capacity dealing with seasonal hired labour. With huge youth unemployment in Ethiopia, youth are especially vulnerable. The project reduces Ethiopian coffee workers' and producers' vulnerability to climate change, natural disasters, human rights' violations and social exclusion. The project's planning phase will start in 2016 with participatory planning workshops and analysis with stakeholders. In the conception phase in 2015 preliminary ideas were agreed and the project responds to the vulnerability challenges by enhancing farmers' skills of sustainable production and strengthening organisational capacity with particular focus on human resource managerial skills. The project also promotes multi-cropping as a way to decrease vulnerability to both market shocks and natural pest outbreaks or irregular weather patterns among coffee farmers. The project's development goal is to contribute to sustainable living standards for coffee workers and producers. The project's purpose is that vulnerability of coffee workers and producers is decreased. Beneficiaries are over 170.000 coffee producers and nearly 100.000 seasonal workers. Implementing partner organizations are the regional producer network Fairtrade Africa and two local second-level coffee cooperatives. The project focuses especially on youth, women and poorest farmers and workers. http://www.fairtradeafrica.net/",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

It supported 15 service-providers in five Sub-Saharan countries by providing them with technological and clinical support as well as advice to foster the social inclusion of the targeted people.This project during its implementation period, in Madagascar, Tanzania, Togo, Zambia and Somalia supported a total of 9 government- and privately-run physical rehabilitation centres, and 2 institutes that trained physical rehabilitation professionals. Between 2015 and 2016, in these five countries, this contributed to the provision of physical rehabilitation services to some 37,000 people. In 2016 the number of persons with disabilities receiving services increased compared to 2015 with 22,000 people, including nearly 9,000 women and 14,000 children. Governments, particularly health ministries (MoH), began to see the importance of having national platforms for advocating policies to strengthen their country's physical rehabilitation sector. Especially, Madagascar, Tanzania and Togo established such platforms, which comprised representatives from the government, providers of physical rehabilitation services, training institutions, DPOs, and Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The project in order to ensure the sustainability of partners signed Agreements (MoU) with MoH (in Madagascar, Tanzania, Togo), developed national plan and policy platform (in Madagascar, Tanzania, Togo), MoU signed with key partners (in Somali Rec Crescent Society), and proposed MoU to Zambian MoH. For improving the quality of physical rehabilitation service, the project provided training to 591 number of professionals including: management trainings (112 persons), clinical P&O and PT trainings (244 persons), mother of children with cerebral palsy (179 mothers), OADCPH training (56 persons). The project also included On-line training (joint ICRC MoveAbility Physiopaedia on-line worldwide training) to over 800 persons, renovation of teaching facilities (ENAM institute) in Togo, as well as creating of a regional training facility in Tanzania. Despite this progress, governments worldwide still need to step up their efforts to take the lead in establishing or presiding over these platforms, and to create entities within their health ministries for overseeing the physical rehabilitation sector. They also need to bolster the development of national plans for physical rehabilitation, whether separately or as part of a broader plan for addressing non-communicable diseases.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

The school intends to support and encourage a burgeoning community of young filmmakers in Myanmar. Since 2005 YFS has brought together international practitioners and young Myanmar of both genders from all walks of life and ethnicities for regular intensive trainings in all aspects of filmmaking, but with a particular emphasis on documentary. The YFS's curriculum includes screenwriting and the production of fictional, script-based works with a documentary sensibility known as 'True Fictions'. The YFS has produced 40 films for Myanmar's development sector promoting human rights and behavioural change. YFS also cooperated on a short film for MTV Exit's 'Enslaved' campaign. This film was broadcast on national television. Almost 200 films have been screened at 223 film festivals in Myanmar and internationally, winning 24 international awards. YFS has recently edited and post-produced a major 8-part television series on the rule of law in Myanmar, which received excellent reviews and was viewed by almost 5 million people across the country. Since its inception in 2005, the YFS has prioritized inclusion and gender equality in all aspects of their work. The film school targets gender, different ethnic groups, and people living with disabilities and marginalized communities. By actively promoting women in managerial, artistic and technical roles, YFS is spearheading gender mainstreaming in the film industry and the media - both traditionally male-dominated industries.YFS is a well established organization. By founding a permanent school with a regular curriculum since its inception in 2005, the YFS stands as an artistic intelligentsia in Myanmar. YFS has succeeded in generating income by producing documentaries for INGOs, CSOs and aid agencies in Myanmar. The production of documentaries has become a source of income, led entirely by the students themselves with a minimum of input from international tutors and mentors. In addition, students have managed to continue with their careers as independent producers, directors, cinematographers, sound engineers, editors, and screenwriters, contributing to a more diverse media culture and to the development of civil society in Myanmar as a whole. Well over 70% of YFS alumni find gainful employment in the media, either immediately following or often alongside their studies. This proves that the YFS is a successful and cost efficient institution.The YFS strengthen civil society in Myanmar by developing a young, skilled media workforce capable of serving the audio-visual needs of the development sector and create a diverse media culture in Myanmar.

This study aims to continue and deepen the temporal and spatial surveillance of selection of molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance as an early warning system of evolution and spread of P. falciparum tolerance/resistance against ACT in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania, and Zanzibar. In addition, we will study if the efficacy, i.e. parasite clearance times (both by a novel real time PCR based quantitative method and by microscopy) and PCR corrected cure rates, of artesunate-amoduaquine in Zanzibar and artemether-lumefantrine in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania, for treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria has been impaired by the selection of ACT tolerance/resistance markers that occurred in the respective parasite populations during a decade of wide scale ACT use. The data will provide improved understanding of the evolution of ACT resistance, and thus an opportunity for optimized surveillance strategies for ACT resistance.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

A significant portion of this burden is preventable, but most countries in the region lack the research capacity to analyze environmental health risks and assess policy implications. In addition, government infrastructure for environmental health monitoring, regulation, and enforcement is limited. To tackle these multi-dimensional challenges, this project aims to establish a regional hub of training and research excellence in eastern Africa with Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The primary focus is to reduce the effects of indoor and outdoor air pollution, which is responsible for high and rising rates of disease and death in the region. The project also addresses emerging occupational health and safety problems from climate change in agriculture. Pilot research aims to analyze and reduce occupational heat stress in key industries of the region (e.g., flower greenhouses), engaging industry to validate models for predicting current and future health risks to workers. The long-term objectives of the project are to build capacity and leadership in eastern Africa for conducting cutting-edge multidisciplinary health research, extending a solution-oriented research portfolio to other countries, and addressing key priority problems in the region on environmental and occupational health. The project is being implemented under the Global Environmental and Occupational Health initiative led by the Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health in collaboration with Canada's International Development Research Centre. The overall research component of the hub is led by Ethiopia's Addis Ababa University in collaboration with Uganda's Makerere University, Maasai Mara University and Great Lakes University of Kisumu in Kenya, and the University of Rwanda.

The project will continue the cooperation established during the Msunduza Dry Sanitation Project (MDSP project code 28000301) and the Environmental Health Education Project (EHEP) and combine and utilise the best practices from the two projects. During the project the cooperation network between the University of Swaziland (UNISWA) Green Living Movement (GLM) Swaziland the Turku University of Applied Sciences (TUAS) and the City Council of Mbabane (CC) will organise trainings in Mnyamatsini Mangwaneni and Malagwane in sanitation waste management (reduce reuse and recycle) and grey water reuse. The education will target especially the youth of the communities which will gain skills for income generating activities (e.g. in dry toilet construction gardening and waste collection). A network between the youth groups will be established for peer support. Through them the benefits will be spread to the entire community.Education will target also authorities of the field as well as representatives of different medias in order disseminate improved sanitation and waste management schemes further and to promote open discussion of the development challenges. Through UNISWA the dissemination is further enhanced by inclusion of future professionals in environmental health integration of project themes and results in their curricula and by provide research on critical project themes such as health risks of human originated fertilisers and test-fields with comparative analysis.Cooperation between the two local partners UNISWA and GLM will enable organisational capacity building and transfer of know-how for a new local NGO with limited resources. Hence they will gain valuable local networks experience of field work and skills of project management in practise.Women's and girls' participation in trainings youth groups and decision-making is emphasized. Inequality will be decreased through inclusion of the disadvantaged through increases in income and by access to sanitation. Affects of the climate change can already be seen in Swaziland as consecutive droughts which is mitigated by constructing waterless sanitation facilities with rainwater harvesting systems and grey water reuse.,Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

Improved fact-finding skills and improved professionalism of local journalists is expected to increase citizens? access to relevant information. A free media is an important key to holding decision-makers accountable.The lack of skills among local journalists to find simple and relevant information through the internet is a huge obstacle for the freedom of expression in Tanzania. Study programmes at journalism schools are also outdated and need reviewing especially in order to include the use of internet for fact-finding and more investigative journalistic research.Key activities include:1. Training of trainers and local journalists in Tanzanian upcountry regions at journalism schools and community radio stations in the use of internet with a special focus on women journalists. Up to 400 journalists mostly from upcountry regions will take part in the internet training courses during four years.2. Radio journalism training and support to Jamii FM community radio station in Mtwara in southern Tanzania including special support to programme production by women journalists and persons with disabilities. The radio broadcast reaches almost one million people in rural communities.3.

The project started in 2011. The project purpose is on the one hand to facilitate revision of the government?s ICT policy and strengthening of the capacity of the Ministry of Communication Science and Technology of Tanzania (MCST) and national institutions and on the other hand strengthening of the business environment in Tanzania especially from a perspective of technology enterprises and innovations. Practical innovation solutions will be developed within the framework of the innovation program. Project?s mid-term review was carried out in 2013. The mid-term review brought out that the components related to the revision of government?s ICT-policy and strengthening of the ministry had faced problems and delays but the innovation component had instead progressed well and produced significant results. Innovation spaces have been created for young technology entrepreneurs which has promoted generation of well-functioning entrepreneur communities. Community based innovation activity has also got off a good start in six regions as well as business incubator activity and cooperation with the most important universities in Tanzania. The mid-term review found that the project had also promoted the IT-skills entrepreneurship and innovation of vulnerable groups (women disabled youthpeople of remote and poor communities). The mid-term review recommended additional funding for the innovation component in order to achieve the original objectives and increase their impact further. The objective of the additional funding is to apply well-functioning concepts of Finland?s innovation system more broadly in Tanzania increase support to women entrepreneurs Living Lab centers and innovation spaces. The revision of ICT-policy and strengthening of the capacity of the Ministry are progressing again after delays. The original budget for the project is 5 million euros. Additional funding is 08 million euros. The project period is 2011-15. Main actors: MCST COSTECH universities civil society organizations and private enterprises.

Aids Foundation of South Africa (AFSA) will implement the intervention together with two sub-recipients (Section 27 and Treatment Action Campaign) to achieve four main objectives: 1) Strengthen knowledge exchange, cross-learning and networking between SRHR practitioners and support joint advocacy and solidarity among Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the region, through the enhancement and expansion of a regional knowledge management portal and network.2) Forge and develop strategic partnerships with relevant national and regional CSOs to strengthen action and advocacy for the advancement of SRHR in ESA by:a) addressing systemic problems of health service delivery and governance that negatively impact on SRHR;b) broadening the struggle for universal HIV/AIDS treatment access and integrated SRH services;c) supporting duty bearers to implement commitments;d) building CSO capacity and solidarity to hold duty bearers accountable.3) Equip targeted marginalised populations with information and support to respond to SRHR challenges (including GBV, SOGI/ LGBTIQ+ rights, migrant and disability rights, adolescent SRHR, including forced/early marriage, and access to safe, legal abortion), through face-to-face, online and social media communication.4) Support evidence-based, culturally relevant local, national and regional advocacy for comprehensive SRHR for all with quality research, through: a) facilitating collaborative research with Regional Network partners; b) engaging leaders on the consequences of denying SRHR, both for local development and the achievement of the SDGs;c) Sharing effective practice in transformative leadership.Eighteen (18) countries (Angola, Botswana, Comoros, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Reunion, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) have been selected based on AFSA and its two sub-recipients capacity to develop networks in these countries in an efficient and cost-effective way as well as Sex Rights Africa Network current country membership and the physical presence of partners in these countries.

This has negative effects on service delivery, public investments and the possibility to implement priorities as decided through the democratic process. The lack of a credible budget process undermines transparency, participation and accountability.The Economic and Fiscal Governance Programme (EFGP) will address the above development constraint by focusing on the domestic resource mobilisation, the credibility of the budget and the implementation of the budget. The main results the support more specifically aims to contribute to are better compliance to procurement regulations and that the budget becomes more credible with execution getting closer to budget with regard to: aggregate expenditures; domestic tax revenue; non-tax revenue and; central government transfer to districts. Incentives for change will be created by linking additional budget resources to progress in these areas. This makes up the contribution's main component and more than 98 percent of the total contribution budget. It should be noted that this is a new modality in a complex setting where the intervention logic cannot be fully analysed which bring a high level of uncertainty to the outcome. To this, a smaller component with complementary technical support is added to assist in the development of laws, regulations, systems and capacity associated with the contribution's overarching objective. The intention is to be able to respond with technical support to special needs in a timely manner. It will be more flexible and be able to more quickly respond to identified needs than what is the case with the technical support currently being provided through Public Financial Management Reform Programme and the Public Expenditure Review Basket Fund for which the decision processes often takes a long time. An example of a potentially strategic activity which could be financed by the complementary technical support component is an exchange between the Tanzania Parliament's Budget Committee and its Swedish equivalent with the purpose to learn from how Sweden managed to the break the cycles of overcommitted budgets for which there were not sufficient funding.In the long term, the intervention will strengthen Tanzania's capacity to pursue its strategies for development and poverty reduction.",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

A significant portion of this burden is preventable, but most countries in the region lack the research capacity to analyze environmental health risks and assess policy implications. In addition, government infrastructure for environmental health monitoring, regulation, and enforcement is limited. To tackle these multi-dimensional challenges, this project aims to establish a regional hub of training and research excellence in eastern Africa with Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The primary focus is to reduce the effects of indoor and outdoor air pollution, which is responsible for high and rising rates of disease and death in the region. The project also addresses emerging occupational health and safety problems from climate change in agriculture. Pilot research aims to analyze and reduce occupational heat stress in key industries of the region (e.g., flower greenhouses), engaging industry to validate models for predicting current and future health risks to workers. The long-term objectives of the project are to build capacity and leadership in eastern Africa for conducting cutting-edge multidisciplinary health research, extending a solution-oriented research portfolio to other countries, and addressing key priority problems in the region on environmental and occupational health. The project is being implemented under the Global Environmental and Occupational Health initiative led by the Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health in collaboration with Canada's International Development Research Centre. The overall research component of the hub is led by Ethiopia's Addis Ababa University in collaboration with Uganda's Makerere University, Maasai Mara University and Great Lakes University of Kisumu in Kenya, and the University of Rwanda.

A significant portion of this burden is preventable, but most countries in the region lack the research capacity to analyze environmental health risks and assess policy implications. In addition, government infrastructure for environmental health monitoring, regulation, and enforcement is limited. To tackle these multi-dimensional challenges, this project aims to establish a regional hub of training and research excellence in eastern Africa with Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The primary focus is to reduce the effects of indoor and outdoor air pollution, which is responsible for high and rising rates of disease and death in the region. The project also addresses emerging occupational health and safety problems from climate change in agriculture. Pilot research aims to analyze and reduce occupational heat stress in key industries of the region (e.g., flower greenhouses), engaging industry to validate models for predicting current and future health risks to workers. The long-term objectives of the project are to build capacity and leadership in eastern Africa for conducting cutting-edge multidisciplinary health research, extending a solution-oriented research portfolio to other countries, and addressing key priority problems in the region on environmental and occupational health. The project is being implemented under the Global Environmental and Occupational Health initiative led by the Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health in collaboration with Canada's International Development Research Centre. The overall research component of the hub is led by Ethiopia's Addis Ababa University in collaboration with Uganda's Makerere University, Maasai Mara University and Great Lakes University of Kisumu in Kenya, and the University of Rwanda. The research component is closely integrated with a tailored training program for research leaders in the region headed by the universities of Southern California and Wisconsin-Madison.",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

Preventing blindness from trachoma has broad and profound impact on health and well-being. It is caused by repeated infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct). The WHO-endorsed SAFE-Strategy aims to control infection through annual, single-dose, community-wide azithromycin treatment coupled with Water/Sanitation/Hygiene (WASH) and fly-control measures to suppress transmission. However, particularly in hyperendemic regions, the current approach is not having the anticipated impact. There are two critical issues. Firstly, current azithromycin schedules appear insufficient. Secondly, transmission routes are poorly defined and the very limited evidence-base makes it hard to focus WASH interventions and guide programmatic decisions. We propose the following: 1) Conduct intensive observation of human behaviour and hygiene practice, and fly behaviour, combined with Ct infection mapping, to identify major routes of transmission. 2) Develop and test contextually appropriate, practical, targeted WASH and fly-control approaches to interrupt Ct transmission. 3) Our modelling work indicates double-dose azithromycin two weeks apart is much more effective in controlling Ct.

Project: Towards GAS vaccines: WHO Preferred Product Characteristics and technical roadmap. Grantee location: Switzerland. Description: Group A streptococcus (GAS) causes an important disease burden, with approximately 18 million people suffering from a serious GAS disease, 1.8 million new cases each year and 517,000 deaths annually. A great proportion of the disease burden lies in low and middle income countries. GAS pharyngitis and skin infections are very frequent, around the globe. The greatest burden is due to rheumatic heart disease, but invasive GAS diseases (including maternal sepsis) also contribute significantly, together with acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. GAS pharyngitis is a very important contributor to global antibiotic use.There is an important need to reinforce current control strategies and develop new primary prevention strategies including vaccines. Through this project, WHO IVR will develop a technical R&D roadmap and Preferred Product Characteristics, serving as guidance documents for stakeholders involved in GAS vaccine research, with the aim to promote and accelerate vaccine development. Preferrences will be defined for main vaccine characteristics and priority actions will be idendified.

Project: Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellowship. Grantee location: Unknown. Description: Science and technology are rewriting our world at an ever faster pace, but the way journalists cover these topics has barely changed for decades.I want to re-engineer the kind of journalism that I, and science journalists worldwide, produce about science. I want to develop new, more thoughtful, more interactive journalism formats that raise the level of public conversation about scientific research and how it affects us.My vision is for this new type of journalism to empower audiences with scientific thinking, link research to their changing world and give them the tools to take control of their day-to-day lives. I want to use my time on the Fellowship to develop new ideas and methods, and then become the leading science journalist in delivering these new formats across TV, radio, print, digital and beyond.Journalists reach millions of people every day, and members of the public invite us into their homes to help understand the messy world around them. As critical friends of science, rather than cheerleaders, journalists have a valuable role in public engagement.But we need do it better, now more than ever. The rise of fake news and a growing distrust of expertise are both contributing to the so-called post-truth world. Scholarship and authority are under attack in many places where Enlightenment values once held sway. I want to develop a way of doing science-journalism that goes some way to counteract this damaging rise of distrust. For public health, this is especially critical - here, public trust and engagement is arguably as important as the scientific research endeavour itself.We should not be satisfied with simply broadcasting information about the latest discoveries. Re-engineering science journalism means moving away from standard newspaper, web or TV reports, and developing ways for people to get more deeply involved in the science. The new formats I want to develop might allow audiences to shape and evolve stories; or help journalists initiate dynamic conversations with - and between - members of the audience who might not normally interact. Working with with coders, theatre directors, filmmakers and journalists in other fields, I want to learn how to connect with new audiences and make a step-change in the type, impact and reach of my work.I see these new formats being used to tackle complex topics that have the most impact on our lives but which are knotty, under-reported or nowadays considered too complex to report in mainstream news outlets. Often, these are also the areas in which people who are not already science-savvy find themselves most viscerally connected to research, such as biomedicine, public health, antimicrobial resistance, mental health, climate change, consciousness, artificial intelligence, disease outbreaks or synthetic biology.One of the best ways to ensure that the benefits of scientific",No gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

New low cost energy resources, such as rice husk, straw and coconut shell briquettes are needed since wood has become scarce and the price increases continuously. Unfortunately the new energy resources accelerate the problem with high concentrations of particles and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. WHO states that air pollution is the largest single environmental health risk and most severe is the household pollution due to indoor smoke from cooking fuel. The objective of this project is to develop better understanding of how soot particles are formed in biomass combustion, how they burn in the fire and how the resulting ash can be removed from the exhaust. At Gadjah Mada University in Indonesia we will do experimental studies of how briquettes of different design will burn and form soot. At Chalmers University we will focus on how soot particles burn in the fire and can be trapped downstream. The co-workers in Indonesia have experience in briquette manufacturing and small scale biomass combustion. The group at Chalmers has experience in Computational Fluid Dynamics and in removing and burning particles in diesel exhaust.

Most widely known is perhaps the case of  arsenic in drinking water bores in Bangladesh and arsenic and fluoride in other ODA countries especially across SE Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Manganese is the latest element for which there is a growing and deeply concerning body of epidemiological evidence indicating adverse effects on human health. For example, [1] calls for an re-evaluation of international guideline values for manganese in drinking water because of associations with neurological symptoms. Specifically for Bangladesh, [2] concluded that children are at risk for manganese-induced neurotoxicity and preliminary findings from [3] indicate a possible association between manganese exposure and infant mortality. In response, developing countries need to rapidly develop manganese mitigation strategies to reduce exposure where elevated levels are detected in drinking water. This requires input from three key disciplines: biogeochemistry, water treatment engineering, and robust measurement technology.A manganese mitigation strategy is needed for Bangladesh. This project has the aim of developing a roadmap to this manganese mitigation strategy. This will be achieved through establishing collaboration between relevant expertise in the UK and Bangladesh and co-creating the roadmap with stakeholders in Bangladesh.  This agile research base will also allow the team to respond to further ODA funding calls. [1] Wasserman et al 2006.

They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries. The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world. It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000 ? each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects. Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %. A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO's have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created. Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is also member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee.

2016161328,1ETH1,2017,C01,ODA Grants,Finland,Ethiopia,,0.00215075,Industrial crops/export crops,F.a: Reduction of vulnerability in Ethiopian coffee production,F.A: REDUCTION OF VULNERABILITY IN ETHIOPIAN COFFEE PRODUCTION,"Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, has more than 1.2 million coffee growers, 95% of which are smallholders, and around 16 million households, nearly a fifth of the population, depend on coffee for their livelihood. Coffee contributes a third of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Ethiopian coffee farmers face challenges like low productivity, quality inconsistency, lack of access to capital, lack of direct sales contacts and marketing skills. As temperatures rise and rains become more erratic, Ethiopian coffee farmers have seen decreasing yields. A poorly developed insurance market prevents people without collateral from getting access to credit, and leave farmers vulnerable when facing, for example, droughts and diseases on coffee trees. It also prevents farmers from affording the investment required for diversification of farming income. In rural areas, manual agricultural wage workers are in the very weakest position. Small producer organisations usually don't have capacity dealing with seasonal hired labour. With huge youth unemployment in Ethiopia, youth are especially vulnerable. The project reduces Ethiopian coffee workers' and producers' vulnerability to climate change, natural disasters, human rights' violations and social exclusion. The project's planning phase will start in 2016 with participatory planning workshops and analysis with stakeholders. In the conception phase in 2015 preliminary ideas were agreed and the project responds to the vulnerability challenges by enhancing farmers' skills of sustainable production and strengthening organisational capacity with particular focus on human resource managerial skills. The project also promotes multi-cropping as a way to decrease vulnerability to both market shocks and natural pest outbreaks or irregular weather patterns among coffee farmers. The project's development goal is to contribute to sustainable living standards for coffee workers and producers. The project's purpose is that vulnerability of coffee workers and producers is decreased. Beneficiaries are over 170.000 coffee producers and nearly 100.000 seasonal workers. Implementing partner organizations are the regional producer network Fairtrade Africa and two local second-level coffee cooperatives. The project focuses especially on youth, women and poorest farmers and workers. http://www.fairtradeafrica.net/",Partial gender component,None,potential false negative,Not inclusion,Not employment

To tackle these multi-dimensional challenges, this project aims to establish a regional hub of training and research excellence in eastern Africa with Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The primary focus is to reduce the effects of indoor and outdoor air pollution, which is responsible for high and rising rates of disease and death in the region. The project also addresses emerging occupational health and safety problems from climate change in agriculture. Pilot research aims to analyze and reduce occupational heat stress in key industries of the region (e.g., flower greenhouses), engaging industry to validate models for predicting current and future health risks to workers. The long-term objectives of the project are to build capacity and leadership in eastern Africa for conducting cutting-edge multidisciplinary health research, extending a solution-oriented research portfolio to other countries, and addressing key priority problems in the region on environmental and occupational health.
